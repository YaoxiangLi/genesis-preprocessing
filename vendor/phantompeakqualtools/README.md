February 2013 upstream revision 50717f350877868a337039f26940eb0b0131332c
changed the NSC/RSC baseline from the minimum correlation to correlation at the
largest tested shift. Later changes include SOCK workers, early dependency
loading, and compatibility with newer SPP versions. The workflow retains the
historical explicit shift range (-s=-0:2:400), but scores can differ because of
the baseline change and full-length bwa-mem2 first-read alignments.

The workflow supplies GNU awk for the script's BAM-to-tagAlign conversion.
