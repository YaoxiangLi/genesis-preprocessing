# Genesis workflow maps

The README map describes the implemented validation workflow. Routes show data
dependencies, not measured execution order or performance. Station titles name
the tools or operations; circles indicate stages and plain crossings do not
implicitly join channels. FastQC observes each raw mate independently. SPP uses
a separate shortened-read alignment and is not currently parsed into MultiQC.
The chapter labels are reading guides, not synchronization barriers.

The architecture map distinguishes implemented DAP-seq processing, experimental
bulk ATAC, tested pseudobulk/multiome contracts and planned barcode processing.
Dashed lines and explicit text mark work outside the implemented DAP workflow. Biological replicates are not implicitly pooled.

Edit `render_metro.py` to update station labels, data dependencies and layout, then
run `python docs/diagrams/render_metro.py`. It uses only Python's standard library
and deterministically generates the static, animated and architecture SVGs.
The SVG metadata records the SHA256 of the documented `main.nf`; it is not a
claim about an upstream release. Update a map with its corresponding workflow
change. Do not depict validation-only features as available in an upstream revision
which does not contain them.

The original Genesis artwork uses the metro-map visual convention, inspired by
the [nf-core/rnaseq map](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/docs/images/nf-core-rnaseq_metro_map_animated.svg).
SVG text remains editable and selectable. The assets contain no external fonts,
scripts, remote resources or raster images. Native CSS animates small route
markers; the static SVG works without animation. Reduced-motion and print media
disable moving markers, and the palette adapts to dark mode.

Before committing, regenerate and inspect the static SVG at full size and README
width, the animated version in a browser, and the architecture status labels.
Check XML validity and compare routes with the actual Nextflow channels. Screenshots
and browser validation evidence belong in the validation workspace's results,
not the source repository.
